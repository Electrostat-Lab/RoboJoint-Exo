# RoboJoint-Exo
A micro-smart bionic joint interface system simulating the biomechanics of human joints integrating AI models for augmentation of balance and smoothening of tone emulating the fine-grained smooth control of the human cerebellum.

RoboJoint-Exo features exoskeleton system implementation through connecting human body joints together via a single CPU/MCU by employing interconnected joint modules and synchronizing them through interrupt I/O and I/O polling.

The project aims at providing a reliable framework to build robust human exoskeletons that supports the joints of the appendicular skeleton; which are severly imparied in morbid disorders; of the most of them are the stroke syndromes affecting the Middle and Anterior Cerebral circulations, and anterior cord syndromes irrespective of the cause. In addition, the project provides compatibility for other localized joint disorders including; ligametnous tears and joint instabilities, but excluding advanced knee osteoarthritis and fractures of long bones.
